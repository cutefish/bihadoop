Applications that will benefit from data reuse

Trade-off between network/IO and number of processors.

Co-clustering: row-clustering and transpose can share.
K-means: share between iteration.
Matrix-Multiplication: block-wise.

Iterative Graph Application:PageRank, RandomWalkWithRestart, DiameterEstimation, ConnectedComponents;

MaximumFlow?

Good fits: User rate system; Image processing task.


Designs: cache --> coherence?
